If you are not familiar with postman, the postman is just a tool to make rest calls. Using postman, you can share the API calls with others.
Below, I'm sharing four collections for the lessons in this section. 
How to import these collections to your postman:
1- download postman from the internet.
2- click on the file menu, select Import.
3- From the pop up select Import From Link tab. 
4- paste any of the below URLs and hit import.
5- on the upper left side click on the Collections tab, then you will find all the APIs in that collection.
